# 3D Stack Game
The objective of this project was to study the concepts of 3D programming with javascript using the library three.js, alongside cannon.js to apply the physics of the blocks.
As future work, I want to make some minor optimizations on this code, and, furthermore,  I'm aiming to create some VR applications using three.js.
